# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	
The purpose of this challenge was to get acquainted with Excel and to gain a greater understanding of the 
software. Learning pivot tables and charts will be something used very regularly in data analysis, and building the
foundation of Excel will assist in future data-analytic work.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	
  Using a pivot table, we took a deeper look at all of the data given to us in the Kickstarter research. We were able to filter this data to better look at a smaller amount of this in a more legible format. Then using this smaller portion of data we were able to create a table that could be shown to almost anyone and be understood by them. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
  By using the "COUNTIFS()" function in Excel, we were able to see the data into ranges in a way that is not as easily done in a pivot table. By using this we were able to count the data using specific criteria, in this case, the goal amount and the outcome of the Kickstarter. This new data provides insight into the outcomes not available previously. Then after putting this into a line graph we were able to present it in a very easily digestible format, capable of being understood by many more than previously.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	
  During this process, a major diffculty I ran into was a regular typos when setting up all of the countifs functions. I was able to over come this by only completing the successful column, copy and pasting it over to the failed and canceled column, then using find and replace to replace successful with the other outcomes. This drastically cut down my typos.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The first conclusion I would come to is that launching your Kickstarter in May would lead to the highest chance of a successful Kickstarter. The second is launching one in September or August would lead to the highest chance of the Kickstarter failing. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	A conclusion that I would make about how the goal influences the outcomes is that almost always the more money asked for in the goal, the less likely the goal is to succeed. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	A major limitation of this Dataset is that we do not know how much advertising some of the Kickstarter had, how much each Kickstarter was talked about on social media. This dataset treats every Kickstarter as if each one was simply submitted to the website and only Kickstarter could advertise for them via staff picks or spotlight, but some gained a following on Twitter or Reddit. Another limitation is not knowing the value of each donation, some of these could be fully funded by one enthusiastic donor, while maybe people donated a small amount, a Kickstarter may not have succeeded without an individual someone very excited about the project and willing to put forth more money. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	The other tables I would create are the percentage of failures and successes with the staff picks, spotlight, or both. Then also the converse of this so seeing how Kickstarter not showing a campaign could affect its chances of succeeding.
